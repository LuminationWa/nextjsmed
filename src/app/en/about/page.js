        Eduardo Medina Ylla, dividing his time between the &quot;Banco República&quot; and
        the &quot;Facultad de Derecho&quot;, managed to be accepted as an Industrial
        Property Agent, under registration number 12, in 1968.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Characterized by his eagerness to study all cases in depth for their
        most fervent defense, and by his knowledge of intellectual and
        commercial legislation from around the world, as well as the most
        diverse arts, he created more than fifty patents in various fields:
        mechanics, construction, security.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1980, following the retirement of his former colleague Rómulo Marne
        Aurucci, Eduardo Medina Ylla was chosen to succeed him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also received important offers from several vehicle and construction
        companies to manage their production, all of which he systematically
        rejected due to his inexorable desire for independence and his
        commitment to the Office of Trademarks and Patents.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is said that he does not live from trademarks and patents, but rather
        that he lives them, he breathes them, like a scholar who has chosen to
        work in these fields of material creation in order to understand them in
        depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has led him to three things:
        <br />
        1) Being considered the best defender of difficult cases in The
        Americas, winning many &quot;impossible&quot; cases.
        <br />
        2) Several clients have preferred to pay for his travel expenses so that
        he can personally prepare, control, and present the cases he entrusts to
        his colleagues all across the globe.
        <br />
        3) Architects, doctors, builders, and creatives in general see their
        projects come to life, identifying, obtaining, and maintaining their
        rights &quot;in totum&quot;.
